                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <h3>
                    <p>Our Mission is to inform any incoming students applying to SUNY (State University of New York) schools what they will get themselves into. SUNY schools really give students that feeling of going away and also opens their eyes to new experiences due to the fact that you get to be on campus and engage in many different activities going on. So we want students to know and see what is going at all the other SUNY's. With blogs of different events and activities that we provide on our blog section you can take a look and see what other students think about their SUNY school.</p>
                    <p>Just look at SUNY!  You will learn so much about our campuses by visiting them.  From informal to formal and unstructured to structured, SUNY campuses offer many types of visit opportunities.  These include open houses, campus tours, residence hall tours, information sessions, group visits, admission interviews, overnight stays, meetings with a faculty member or coach, classroom visits, and summer camps and workshops.</p>
                    <p>SUNY students come from all ends of the earth and all walks of life. They’re passionate about the art of discovery, as well as the science of invention. They are global citizens committed to civic responsibility. They’re intellectually curious, thriving on connections with faculty and peers. And, they share a common goal: an education that opens doors. SUNY also fuels New York’s economy by creating jobs for the country’s best and brightest talent in communities all over the state. We seek to attract and retain the highest quality faculty, staff and administration across all our campuses and our 90,000+ employees across 64 campuses represent a diverse array of skills. All of our faculty and staff members support and contribute to our mission in unique ways.</p>
