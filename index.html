            <h1> Looking College Life in the SUNY Systems</h1>
            <p>The State University of New York and the City University of New York are the public university systems in NY State. ... The SUNY and CUNY systems are separate and independent university systems, although both are public institutions that receive funding from New York State, CUNY also receives funding from New York City. SUNY campuses are located across New York State in urban, suburban, and rural areas. From Long Island to Buffalo, from Plattsburgh to Binghamton and everywhere in-between you'll find a SUNY campus.<p>
